<div class="main">
  <h2>Delete all Tasks from Archive</h2>
  <p>
    Do you really want to delete all tasks from the archive forever (they are then also removed from the statistics section)?
  </p>
  <div>
    <button mat-button (click)="dialogRef.close()">Cancle</button>
    <button mat-raised-button color="warn" (click)="deleteAllTasksFromArchive()">Delete</button>
